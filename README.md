FountainEngine Improved!

A Crossplatform C++ OpenGL 2D Game Engine


New Engine In Plan
------------------

From April 2017,

I started working in a game company.

Found a lot of interesting things,

and had many good ideas to improve the engine,

Some are not compatible with the current one,

Especially the renderer.


Some Thoughts Here
------------------

OpenGL 4.2 core profile will be used in the next engine,

which is still compatible with Intel HD4000 in my old laptop.

It means the new renderer will have no fixed-pipeline funtionality,

and will take more adtanvage of display memory.

And I'm going to try FMOD, which is a very good sound library.

FMOD is currently free for small budget project.

I also did some research on Vulkan API recently, it's very low level,

study it can help one to better understand the rendering pipeline,

but it's hard to use, I still need much time to get familiar with that,

probably won't be seen in the next engine.


Some Libs Which Are Confirmed To Be Used
----------------------------------------

OpenGL

glad

glm

GLFW

FMOD


Some Plans
----------

A good demo to indicate the features

A python engine version to help prototyping

Better usage of C++11 features (smart pointer, multithreading)

Have documentation? (doxygen?)

Have unittest?


Conclusion
----------

These engines are more of my self learning projects

My expectation is one day I can use it in Ludum Dare

And at least, I can do some algorithm experiments with it
